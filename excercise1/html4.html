        <h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
        <h2>Page 4</h2>
        <p>In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. My own website,
            including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created in
            HomeSite in 1997.</p>
        <p>Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive Ubu Web site,
            an "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider
            arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of boasted on Twitter that "the whole damn site is still
            hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996."</p>
        <p>I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.</p>
        <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention both to the manual labour
            involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a
            'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run.</p>
        <p>For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. Readers
            have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting,
            and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers.</p>
        <p>In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called Unindexed which continuously
            searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was
            permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared the source code on GitHub, so you too can
            create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it.</p>
        <p>Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfortâ€™s Taroko Gorge (2008). For
            many, this was their first experience 'making' a computer-generated text.</p>
