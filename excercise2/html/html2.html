        <h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
        <h2>Page 2</h2>
        <p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic
            relationship. This is evident in the early output of the <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp">trAce Online Writing Centre</a> founded at
            Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most
            influential online writing communities in the world. trAce’s first output was a <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/writersforthefuture/1995/">word-processed photocopied booklet</a>
             which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,
            trAce’s last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:
            The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions
            about the use of mixed media in writing... The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce
            Archive can easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist’s book. (PDF<a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/traces/traces.pdf">trAces: A
            Commemoration of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce</a> , page 14)
            One of the many interesting things about the <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp">online archive</a> of the trAce Online Writing Centre is
            how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas
            archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere––
            manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom
            ––the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium
            within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to
            change.</p>
        <p>In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011)
                Wolfgang Ernst observes: “If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast
                channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively
                generates sensual and informational presence.” Similarly, when viewing old web pages in
                modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/cyberfest/index.htm">dated web-
                design aesthetics</a> overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath. Pages
                optimised for lower resolutions now take <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/">less than a third of the screen.</a> Ghosts of browsers past
                mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images. Sound files play
                automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us.</p>
        <p>For example, M.D. Coverley’s <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/coverley/index.html">The Personalization of Complexity</a> (2001) “explores the ways in
            which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only
            sometimes manageable by the owners.” Fittingly, the piece itself warns that it is viewable only
            on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support
            many of the features in this essay.</p>
        <p>These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a
            web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making.</p>
