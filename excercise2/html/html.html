        <h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
        <h2>Page 1</h2>
        <div class="wrapper">
            <p>The term “handmade” usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather
            than machines. The result may be homely––as in a child's clay ashtray––or exquisite––as in
            a pair of bespoke brogues.</p>
            <p><b>I evoke the term “handmade web” to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
            software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
            corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
            which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
            identity.</b></p>
            <p>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic
            web and before the corporate web. “Handmade” is by no means the only or best term to define
            the web of this period.</p>
            <p>In her essay, <a href="https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">A Vernacular Web</a> (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:
            bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and
            personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection
            and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com
            ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.
            For more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied's excellent research on the
            amateur web, see: <a href="https://blog.geocities.institute/about">One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age: Digging through the Geocities Torrent.</a></p>
            <p><b>I evoke the term “Handmade web” in order to make a correlation between handmade web
            pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</b></p>
            <p>I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for <a href="https://luckysoap.com/butterflies/parasite.html">Fishes & Flying Things</a> came from the
            material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art
            exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to
            tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that’s the way
            books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story circled round and
            round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one copy. The
            QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of
            which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still
            works.</p>
